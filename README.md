# Enter The Void
Enter the void is an Android game which goal is to put a square into a circle.
The game was developed in three weeks for a school project. It contains eleven levels. Each level have a XML file so more can be added by creating new XML file describing the level. The game will detect the new XML file and automaticaly add the level available to play.

To create a level, you have to specify the coordinates of the circle (end point), the coordinates of the walls, their width and their height. YOu can also specify if touching the wall end the game or not.

A problem remains, the wall colision are not handled properly, you are free to clone the repository and add what you want to the project. Feel free to send me an email!

An other idea is to create a level creator for Android and desktop computer to be able to see what the level looks like wihtout having to compile the game.
